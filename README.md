# Mres_DoL_Modelling
- Behaviour of *Pseudomonas pudida* growth with different carbon source and envirionmental conditions
- would adapt/start with Monod/Michaellis-Menten form modelling

## proposed workflow
- readin OD 600 data (in excel) as dataframe, pre-treat the data
- use data frame as input to estimate the max growth rate, which feed in model
- use kinetic parameters from literature
